# news-website
This was our college project for UI-UX SPECIALIST course. The project was build by me and my friend.
This project is an API based-project. The API used is the news Api.

and later, only the Indian news are being extracted from all the news available.
The project is very innovation thought. 

Also, is very favorable to people, as it has no advertisments or any other kind of disturbances, which makes the user to read lots of news in few minutes only. 
The user is able to the quick headlines of the news on the real time basis. And for the full news, he/she can also recommend to open the url link of the news to new tab also. 

Hope you like the project!!
Keep updated!
